## 🔧 How It Works

### **The Flow:**

```
Admin Dashboard → Upload File → Sanity API (with token) → Sanity Cloud → Your Site
      ↓              ↓                ↓                      ↓            ↓
   Enter data    Select image    Uses your token      Stores safely   Updates live
```

### **Technical Details:**

```javascript
// In src/lib/sanity.js
export const client = createClient({
  projectId: 'khc2znf3',
  dataset: 'production',
  apiVersion: '2023-10-27',
  useCdn: true,
  token: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_TOKEN, // ← Your token here!
});
```

**What happens when you upload:**

1. You select a file in admin
2. Admin calls `uploadImage(file)`
3. Function uses your Sanity token
4. File uploads to Sanity Cloud
5. Sanity returns image URL
6. Project/Gallery created with image reference
7. Frontend fetches updated content
8. New content appears on site!

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### **✅ Already Implemented:**

1. **Token in `.env` file** (not in code)
2. **`.gitignore` protecting** `.env` files
3. **Vite prefix** (`VITE_`) for environment variables
4. **Token never exposed** in client-side code

### **⚠️ Important Reminders:**

1. **Never commit `.env` to Git** ✋
   - Already in `.gitignore` ✅
   - But double-check before pushing

2. **Don't share your token** 🔒
   - Keep it private
   - Regenerate if exposed

3. **For production deployment:**
   - Add token to hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)
   - Use environment variables section
   - Never hardcode in files

---

## 🗂️ Sanity Studio Access

### **Your Sanity Studio URL:**
```
https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/khc2znf3
```

**What you can do in Sanity Studio:**
- View all content
- Edit directly in Sanity UI

## 🔄 Fallback System

**Don't worry if Sanity isn't set up yet!**

Your site has **fallback content** that displays when:

- API token is missing
- Network is offline
- Sanity is down

**Fallback includes:**
- Sample projects
- Sample team members
- Sample gallery images
- Everything works locally!

## 🎓 Common Tasks

### **View Your Uploaded Content:**

**In Sanity Studio:**
1. Go to https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/khc2znf3
2. Click "Vision" (query tool)
3. Run query: `*[_type == "project"]`
4. See all your projects!

**Query Examples:**
```groq
// All projects
*[_type == "project"] | order(date desc)

// All gallery images
*[_type == "gallery"] | order(_createdAt desc)

// All videos
*[_type == "video"]

// All team members
*[_type == "team"] | order(order asc)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Upload failed"**

**Solutions:**
1. Check token is in `.env`
2. Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
3. Verify token starts with `VITE_`
4. Check Sanity project ID is correct

### **Issue: "Cannot read token"**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart the dev server
pkill -f "vite"
npm run dev
```

Environment variables only load on server start!

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**

**Check:**
1. Token has write permissions
2. Go to Sanity dashboard
3. Settings → API → Tokens
4. Verify token permissions = "Editor"

---

## 📱 Testing Upload

### **Quick Test:**

1. Open admin: http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login
3. Go to "Upload Photo" tab
4. Select a small test image
5. Click "Upload Photo"
6. **→ Watch progress bar!**
7. **→ See success toast!**
8. Go to main site
9. Scroll to Gallery section
10. **→ Your photo is there!** 🎉

---

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### **When deploying to Vercel/Netlify:**

**Add Environment Variable:**

1. Go to project settings
2. Find "Environment Variables"
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `VITE_SANITY_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** `sk4yu7Xw...` (your token)
4. Add other variables:
   - `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=khc2znf3`
   - `VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production`
5. Redeploy

**Your site will then have full CMS access in production!**
